## Machine learning project
# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is based on credit card payment information of 30,000 customers from Taiwan, collected over six months from April 2005 to September 2005. This dataset has been widely used in previous studies and has been considered an important benchmark dataset for credit risk analysis. The dataset contains 23 attributes including demographic information such as age, sex, and marital status, as well as credit card-specific information such as payment history, amount of bill statement, and payment amount. The main goal of the previous studies that used this dataset was to predict the likelihood of default on credit card payments using different machine learning and statistical techniques. The literature suggests that this dataset has provided promising results in developing accurate credit risk models, and the features included in the dataset have been found to be important predictors of credit risk.
